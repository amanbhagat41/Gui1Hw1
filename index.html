                Hello my name is Aman Bhagat and I am a senior at Umass Lowell
                majoring in Computer Science. I want to hopefully get a job
                in Cybersecurity or in IT, I want to get a job in one of these
                since I do not like to code that much anymore and it seems like
                fun to work in one of these. I am taking intro to comp security and
                so far it is fun so I hope to continue with it. I like to listen to music and
                generally like all genres of music but country. I enjoy
                playing tennis and playing video games. I like to play
                games like league of legends and minecraft which I have been 
                playing since I was very young and still continue to enjoy.

                Tennis is my favorite hobby and thing to do in my free time. I
                started playing when I was in highschool and was the captain
                during my senior year, but it was during covid so I did not get 
                to play that year. I stopped playing for a little bit since
                I was focused on college but started playing again and found out
                how fun it is again. I also enjoy watching tennis and favorite
                player is

                  >Ben Shelton</a
                >
                for men's. I like these tennis players because I saw a video on
                Coco Guaff on youtube when she was 14 and saw her work ethic and
                became a fan from that. I like Ben Shelton because I saw him in
                the 2023 US Open and liked the way he played and his attitude,
                he was very fun to watch and entertaining winning or losing.
